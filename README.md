# Omicron
Omicron is a Command Line Interface -- CLI, that can delete, extract, list, move and organize files.

## Features
- Delete one or all directory's files
- Extract files from ZIP and RAR archives
- List all directory's files 
- Move a file to a directory
- Organize all files in a directory
  

## Motivation
So, I decided to code that project because I was bored that always I needed to organize my directories and folders, and know the challenges building a CLI program,
so Omicron could/ and now helps me doing that!:smile: I was thinking how simple and minimalistic it could works, then I start searching about CLIs and
how it works, googling seemmed easy to code (During the process I discovered that was a bit harder:sweat_smile:).

## Challenges 

### Updates for the future
- Delete
  - Implement functionalities to the user delete files by:
    - Date;
    - File size.
- Extract
  - List the files inside the archive .zip or .rar;
  - Extract just one or more files from the .zip/.rar.
- List Files:
  - Implement list the files by:
    - Date;
    - Size;
    - Name.
